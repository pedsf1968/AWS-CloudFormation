      more than one target type.
      instance - Register targets by instance ID. This is the default value.
      ip - Register targets by IP address. You can specify IP addresses from
      the subnets of the virtual private cloud (VPC) for the target group, the
      RFC 1918 range (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16), and the
      RFC 6598 range (100.64.0.0/10). You can't specify publicly routable IP
      addresses.

      alb - Register a single Application Load Balancer as a target.
    Type: String
  UnhealthyThresholdCount:
    Default: 5
    Description: |
      The number of consecutive health check failures required before
      considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group
      protocol is TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 2. For
      target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 2. If the target
      type is lambda, the default is 5.
    MinValue: 2
    MaxValue: 10
    Type: Number
  VpcId:
